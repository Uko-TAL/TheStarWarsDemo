## Presentation
A 2MB ATARI STE Demo at 50Hz, with Fullscreen and 12.5kHz MOD Music, hundreds of colours, blitter zooming FX...

Just insert the floppy in your 2MB Atari STe, or favorite emulator ! Or copy the .TOS file to the harddrive.

All technical details are mentionned at the end of the demo. All the source files are available in the repo.

And a tutorial to explain the details of the SW Scroller is also available in the repo. 

## Music
I have initially composed the music using modern tools such as Ableton Live and virtual synths, and I have then converted it to the MOD Protracker format. Both versions are provided here:
- The classical M.K. MOD format as played in the demo: https://github.com/Uko-TAL/TheStarWarsDemo/blob/main/Music/Oldskool.mod
- The modern & initial version: https://github.com/Uko-TAL/TheStarWarsDemo/blob/main/Music/Oldskool_ModernVersion.mp3

## Updates
- 2021/08/10: Add a tutorial to explain the details of the scroller
- 2022/09/24: Add the python tool that allows to simulate the scroller and to generate code  

# Enjoy !
